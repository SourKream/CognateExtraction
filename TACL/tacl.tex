\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present a deep learning model for the task of pairwise cognate prediction. We use a character level model with recurrent architecture and attention that has previously been employed on several NLP tasks. We compare the performance of our model with previous approaches on various language families. We also employ our model specifically to the domain of discovering cognates from Hindi-Marathi to assist the task of lexical resource creation.

\section{Introduction}
Cognates are words across different languages that are known to have originated from the same word in a common ancestral language. For example, the English word `\textit{Night}' and the German `\textit{Nacht}', both meaning \textit{Night} and English `\textit{Hound}€™' and German `\textit{Hund}', meaning \textit{Dog} are cognates whose origin can be traced back to Proto-Germanic. 

Traditionally, the identification of cognates was carried out by historical linguists, using word lists and establishing sound correspondences between words. These are useful in determining linguistic distance within a language family, and also to understand the process of language change. While the task of cognate identification is an interesting problem in its own right, cognate information has also been used in several downstream NLP tasks, like sentence alignment in bitexts \cite{simard1993using} and improving statistical machine translation models \cite{kondrak2003cognates}. Additionally, it has been proposed that cognates can be used to share lexical resources among languages that are closely related \cite{Singh:07b}.

For some time now, there has been a growing interest in automatic cognate identification techniques. Most approaches for this task focus on finding similarity measures between a pair of words (e.g. orthographic or phonetic similarity). \cite{hauer2011clustering} \cite{inkpen2005similarity} \cite{List2016g}. These are used as features for classifiers to identify cognacy for a particular word-pair. Surface similarity measures like these miss out on capturing generalizations beyond string similarity, as cognate words are not always revealingly similar. For example, the cognate words \textit{Que} in Spanish and \textit{Hvad} in Danish both map to the concept \textsc{WHAT}, but have nothing in common with each other orthographically. For such pairs, surface similarity measures that rely on sub-sequence similarity are not useful. Instead, we require information about phonological similarity that is beyond surface similarity, such as the sound correspondences that are used in historical linguistics to narrow down candidate pairs as cognates.

Our paper shows that an end-to-end recurrent neural network based model is able to outperform both surface similarity as well as a recent CNN based Siamese-style model \cite{rama2016siamese} on the task. LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks are being used in an extensive range of NLP tasks to build end-to-end systems. LSTMs have been successfully applied to machine translation \cite{bahdanau2014neural}. language modeling \cite{mikolov2010recurrent}, information retrieval \cite{sordoni2015hierarchical} and RTE \cite{snli:emnlp2015}. In the subsequent sections, we describe our LSTM based Siamese-style architecture which uses character by character attention to enrich the representations of the input word pairs and make the cognate prediction. We perform thorough analysis on the performance of our model and compare it against existing supervised approaches, including the subsequence based model described in \cite{rama2015automatic} and its variants.

%A key observation is that language-based features either with respect to language family or phonetic relationships does not help performance, while semantic information has a positive effect. We find that pre-training on language data unrelated to the language family is also useful, which points to the model's flexibility and its ability to capture statistical regularities without explicit feature engineering.

% We also compare our model's performance with existing supervised approaches, including the subsequence model described in \cite{rama2015automatic} (and its variants). Even if these models are provided with richer character representations in the form of IPA encoding, they are still unable to identify cognate pairs from very broad cognate classes. On the other hand, the LSTM model, even when pre-trained with data from a completely unrelated language family has a much lower error rate.  \textit{Some lines need to be added here about the result pairs}

The task of discovering cognates can possibly be particularly useful among the languages of South Asia, which are not rich in lexical resources. Information about cognates can become an important source for assisting the creation and sharing of lexical resources between languages. Therefore, another contribution of this work is to apply our cognate detection model to a real language pair. We apply our model to the domain of Hindi-Marathi, using a large unlabeled corpus of aligned texts to find cognate pairs.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Related Work}

There have been several previous works for automatic cognate identification that try to exploit different forms of features and representations for capturing the necessary information.

\textbf{Orthographic features based classifier} : \cite{hauer2011clustering} use a number of basic word similarity measures as input to a SVM classifier for cognate prediction. They use features like common bigrams, longest common substring, word length difference etc. The also use features that encode the degree of affinity between pairs of languages.

\textbf{Gap-weighted common subsequences} : \cite{rama2015automatic} uses a string kernel based approach wherein he defines a vector for a word pair using all common subsequences between them and weighting the subsequence by their gaps in the strings. The subsequence based features outperform orthographic word similarity measures.

\textbf{Siamese ConvNet model} : In a recent work, T. Rama introduces CNN based siamese-style model \cite{rama2016siamese} for the task. The model is inspired by image-similarity CNN models. Instead of CNNs, we propose the use of LSTM networks. As these are a form of recurrent network (RNN), they fit more naturally to natural language which also has a sequential architecture and follows a linear order. In comparison, convolutional networks are more hierarchical and hence seem natural for images. Even though NLP literature does not support a clear distinction between the domains where CNNs or RNNs perform better, recent works have shown that each provide complementary information for text classification tasks \cite{yin2017comparative}. 

%We do an extensive analysis of our trained models to try to understand the kinds of features it learns to recognize that are important for making the cognate judgements.

%By using deep learning based models, the need for external feature engineering is avoided and the system outperforms previous works for cognate detection.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Datasets}

The task of cognate identification will make use of word lists taken from the basic vocabulary e.g. kinship terms, body parts, numbers etc. Usually this vocabulary will represent concepts from the language itself and not borrowed items, (although this is also possible at times). The word lists contain information about a particular word, its language family and a cognate class ID. Words are provided for a number of languages for a set of concepts that are from the basic vocabulary.

We make use of three datasets in our work. The first and primary dataset that we use is the IELex Database, which contains cognacy judgements from the Indo-European language family. The dataset is curated by Michael Dunn\footnote{http://ielex.mpi.nl/}. Second, we include a dataset taken from the Austronesian Basic Vocabulary project \cite{greenhillBlust:08}, and a third dataset from the Mayan family \cite{wichmann:2008}. 

There are several differences in transcription in each of these datasets. While IELex is available in both IPA and a coarse `Romanized' IPA encoding, the Mayan database is available in the ASJP format (similar to a Romanized IPA) \cite{Brown:08} and the Austronesian has been semi-automatically converted to ASJP \cite{rama2016siamese}. We use subsets of the original databases due to lack of availability of uniform transcription.

The Indo European database has the largest number of languages (139) as compared to Mayan, which is a much smaller language family consisting of only 30. The Austronesian dataset contains the largest number of cognate classes as compared to the other two. For the purposes of this task, we form word pairs using words from the same concept and such a pair is assigned a positive cognate label if its cognate class ids match. 

We also use the TDIL Hindi-Marathi sentence-aligned corpus as the large unlabeled data for our final model. This dataset provides a large part of the vocabulary from the both the languages to search for cognates.

%The data used for the task consists of annotated word lists. The word lists for different language families contain the cognate class ids for each token, along with its language and concept/meaning label. Word pairs are formed using words from the same concept and are assigned a positive cognate label if their cognate class ids match
%We have primarily used the Indo-European language family for our experiments as are target languages (Hindi and Marathi) belong to this family. But we have additionally also test our models on two other families listed below.

% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \section{Gap-weighted subsequence model}
% Before coming to the LSTM based model, we performed a thorough analysis on the performance of the gap-weighted subsequence model.
% There were two fundamental drawbacks in using the common-subsequence model (Referred to as \textit{Multiplicative} model). 

% Firstly, since the model only looked at common subsequences, it ignored vital information about closely related subsequences such as \textit{`fa'} in FATHER and \textit{`pa'} in PATER which are cognate words. 
% Secondly, this also resulted in very sparse vectors as the feature space size was huge. To overcome these problems, we tried smoothing techniques which resulted in models Hy-Avg, Hy-Norm and Additive.

\section{Approach}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{CoAttNetwork}
    \caption{Recurrent Co-Attention Network for Cognate Discovery}
    \label{CoAttNet}
\end{figure}

The overall model used in our system is called the Recurrent Co-Attention Model (\textit{CoAtt} for short) and is extended from the word-by-word attention model used by \cite{rocktaschel2016reasoning} for the task of recognising textual entailment in natural language sentences. The network used is illustrated in Figure~\ref{CoAttNet}. It is a Siamese style network that encodes a word pair parallely and then makes a discriminative judgement in the final layer. The input words are first encoded into character level embeddings followed by a bidirectional LSTM network and finally a character by character attention layer as described the subsections that follow. The encodings of both the words are merged and passed through a 2-layer neural network with \textit{tanh} and \textit{sigmoid} activations to make a final binary prediction. Additionally we also add a \textit{Language features} vector or a \textit{Concept features} vector to the model by concatenating it with the merged attention vector before passing it to the 2-layer neural network.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Character Embeddings}

The network starts by encoding the input words into their character embeddings. We encode the words using a character level embedding matrix $E \in \mathbb{R}^{n_e \times |C|}$. Here $n_e$ is the size of the character embeddings and $C$ is the vocabulary of all characters. Thus for an input word $x$ which can be represented as sequence of characters $x = \{c_{i_1}, c_{i_2}, ..., c_{i_n}\}$, is transformed into a sequence of vectors $y = \{e_{i_1}, e_{i_2}, ..., e_{i_n}\}$ where $e_j$ is the $j^{th}$ column of the $E$ matrix. This embedding matrix is learnt during training and each column in the matrix represents the embedding vector of the respective token in the vocabulary. 

\cite{rama2016siamese} manually defined the character embeddings using various properties of the respective phoneme and fixed these embeddings during training. However, we observe that such a method restricts the power of the distributional representation to world knowledge known to us and letting the embeddings be learnt themselves should help learn a representation that is tuned for the task in hand. Thus, we use Rama's manually defined embeddings as an initialisation for the character embeddings and let these weights be trained during learning. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{LSTM network}

Recurrent Neural networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been extensively been used in several NLP tasks. After the input words to the network are encoded using the character embedding matrix, we transform them use LSTM cells. Given the input words $y = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_n\}$, at every time step $t$ the LSTM of hidden unit size $n_h$ uses the next input $e_t$, the previous output $h_{t-1}$ and the previous cell state $c_{t-1}$ to compute the next output $h_t$ and the next cell state $c_t$ as follows,

\begin{align}
H &= [e_t h_{t-1}] \\
i_t &= \sigma (W^iH + b^i) \\
o_t &= \sigma (W^oH + b^o) \\
f_t &= \sigma (W^fH + b^f) \\
c_t &= i_t * tanh(W^cH + b^c) + f_t * c_{t-1} \\
h_t &= o_t * tanh(c_t)
\end{align}

Here $W^i$, $W^o$, $W^f$, $W^c \in  \mathbb{R}^{n_e+n_h \times n_h}$ and $b_i$, $b_o$, $b_f$, $b_c \in \mathbb{R}^{n_h}$ are trained weights of the LSTM. The final output of the LSTM gives us a sequence $\{h_1, h_2, ..., h_n\}$ for every word, where $h_j \in \mathbb{R}^{n_h}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Attention}

Attention neural networks have been used extensively in tasks like machine translation \texttt{cite}, image captioning \texttt{cite}, summarisation \texttt{cite} and visual question answering \texttt{cite}. The attention mechanism helps to enhance the representation obtained from the LSTM cell state by giving it context that is used for attending. More precisely, we attend over the LSTM encoding of a given word, using a single characted encoding of the second word, which helps to generate a weighted representation of the first word that includes its important segments with respect to its similarity with the second word's character. 

Given a character vector $h \in  \mathbb{R}^{n_h}$ using which we would like to attend on a sequence of character vectors $Y = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_L\} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_h \times L}$, we generate a set of attention weights $\alpha$ and a attention-weight representation $r \in  \mathbb{R}^{n_h}$ of $Y$ as,

\begin{align}
M &= tanh(W^yY + W^hh*e_L) \\
\alpha &= softmax(w^TM) \\
r &= Y\alpha_t^T
\end{align}

Using the mechanism followed by \cite{rocktaschel2016reasoning} for word-by-word attention, we employ a character-by-character attention model, wherein we find an attention weighted representation of the first word $Y = \{c_1, c_2, ..., c_L\} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_h \times L}$ at every character of the second word $H = \{h_1, h_2, ..., h_N\} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_h \times N}$.

\begin{align}
M_t &= tanh(W^yY + (W^hh_t + W^rr_{t-1})*e_L) \\
\alpha_t &= softmax(w^TM_t) \\
r_t &= Y\alpha_t^T + tanh(W^tr_{t-1})
\end{align}

Here $W^y$, $W^h$, $W^r$, $W^t \in  \mathbb{R}^{n_h \times n_h}$ and $w \in \mathbb{R}^{n_h}$ are trained weights of the Attention layer. The final output gives us $r_N = r_{YH}$ which can considered as attention weighted representation of $Y$ with respect to $H$. Similarly, we also obtain $r_{HY}$. The final feature vector $r^*$ that is passed to the multi-layer perceptron for classification is the concatenation of these 2 vectors.

\begin{align}
r^* &= [r_{HY} r_{YH}]
\end{align}

 This method of making both the sequences attend over each is called the \textit{Co-Attention} model.
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Language Features}

It is known that some languages are more closely related to each other as compared to other languages. Thus, these languages which are closer would naturally tend to share more cognate pairs than they do with other languages. \cite{rama2016siamese} tried to exploit this information about language \textit{relatedness} by providing the network with 2-hot encoding vector that represents the respective languages of the 2 input words being tested. The network would then use this information about the languages to learn which language pairs may be more related using the training data provided.

We follow the same approach used by \cite{rama2016siamese} and provide the model with these addition \textit{Language Features} before the final classification by the 2-layer MLP. The 2-hot input language pair vector $x_{lang}$ is concatenated with the attention weighted representation of the input words $h^{*}$, before being fed into the final multi-layer perceptron for classification.

\subsection{Concept Features}

As the information about the language of the input words can be beneficial for the task of cognate discovery, we hypothesise that information regarding the semantics or the meaning of the input word pair should also be helpful. The word semantics can provide information like the POS category of the word, which can be an useful if some POS classes show higher degree of variation in cognates while others show less.

We implement this by using GloVe word embeddings \cite{pennington2014glove}. Word embeddings are distributional representation of words in a low-dimensional space compared to the vocabulary size and they have been shown to capture semantic information about the words inherently. We use the GloVe embedding for the English concept of the word pair as obtained from the label in the dataset, and input this vector to the network before the final MLP for classification. The word embedding of the concept $x_{concept}$ is concatenated with the attention weighted representation of the input words $h^{*}$, before being fed into the final multi-layer perceptron for classification.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Experiments}

We conducted several types of evaluations on our models covering a variety of test for thorough analysis of its performance. We conducted abalation tests to study the contribution of different features and conducted tests on how the different levels of transcription affects the performance of the models. In the subsections below we describe the results from these different tests.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Evaluation Metric}

We report the \textit{F-score} as a measure of performance for all our models. \textit{F-score} is computed as the harmonic mean of the \textit{precision} and \textit{recall}\footnote{Precision and Recall is computed on positive labels. Precision = TP/(TP+FP), Recall = TP/(TP+FN)}. Since the dataset is heavily biased and contains a majority of negative samples (As can be seen in Tables \ref{CL_count} and \ref{CC_count}), \textit{accuracy} is not a good measure of performance to compare the models.

\subsection{Experiments with Indo-European}

We performed the cross-language evaluation for the Indo-European dataset, where we created training and testing data samples using exclusive sets of languages. We fixed a random set of 70\% of the languages as the training set of languages and the remaining as the testing set. It must be noted that all samples were created by taking words from the same concept .ie. for each word pair in the training and testing set, be it positive or negative, belongs to the same concept.

The training and testing set size details for the different datasets formed using cross language evaluation test can be found in Table~\ref{CL_res}. The results for the cross language evaluation tests for Indo-European are listed in Table~\ref{CL_res}. 

It is observed that the Recurrent Co-attention model (\textit{CoAtt}) performs significantly better than the CNN and the Subsequence models. The \textit{Majority Classifier} model simply outputs the mojority label of the training data. We tested two sanity-check baseline models to test the attention layer of the \textit{CoAtt} model.  The \textit{LSTM + No Attention} model removes the Co-Attention layer from the \textit{CoAtt} model, while the \textit{LSTM + Uniform Attention} model does a simple average rather than a weighted average in the attention layer. These to models clearly show the importance of the Attention layer in the network, as without it the model performs even worse than the majority classifier.

Even though the \textit{CoAtt} model performs better than the other models by itself, adding a few additional modifications helps to imporve its performance further. Initialising the character embeddings with the manually defined binary vectors based on different phonetic properties of the characters, and then allowing these embeddings to change during training increases the \textit{AUC} by around 3\%. Further, adding the \textit{Concept features} discussed earlier, is also found to be useful.

Since the mode of evaluation is cross-language, it is intuitive that the additional \textit{Language Features} will not contribute to the performance of the model since the languages of the training and testing set do not overlap and hence the relevant language feature weights for the test set are never learnt. That is, any information about the affinity or interaction between the languages in the training set is not useful for the languages in the testing set, as they are not common. Hence, we do not use \textit{Language features} with our model for this evaluation mode.

\subsection{Experiments with Multiple Datasets}

As mentioned earlier, other than the Indo-European dataset we also have two more datasets for the task, ie. the Austronesian and the Mayan datasets. Table~\ref{CL_res_2} lists the results of the models on these datasets. We observe a similar trend on the performance of the models on these datasets as we did for Indo-European. However, we can note that by itself, the \textit{CoAtt} model does not train well on the Mayan dataset. In fact its performance is as bad as the baseline models and no where close to the subsequence and the CNN models. This poor performance on the Mayan datasets is associated with the small size of the dataset, which is not sufficient for training the \textit{CoAtt} network. We justify this hypothesis subsequently with the \textit{Cross-Family Pretraining} experiment.

The \textit{Concept features} discussed earlier, are again found useful to improve the \textit{CoAtt} model, especially on the Mayan dataset. Using the extra information about the word meaning from the of input pair from the \textit{Concept features}, the \textit{CoAtt} model is able to cross the baseline performance on the Mayan dataset.

\subsubsection*{Cross Family Pre-training Experiments}

The three different language families with which we work have completely different origins and are placed across different regions geographically. However, it would be interesting to note if any notion of language evolution is still shared amongst these independently evolved language families. We try to test this hypothesis through the joint learning of the model for these families. Particularly since the size of the Mayan dataset available is quite small, it would be interesting to note if some information or feature learning from the other language families could prove beneficial for it. To implement this, we instantiate the network with the combined character vocabulary of the two language families. We then train the model till the loss saturates on one language family. This is followed by the training of the model on the second language family, while using the learned weights from the pre-training as the initialisation. 

It is found that such a joint-training procedure helps the \textit{CoAtt} model on the Mayan dataset significantly. The model trained without the \textit{Concept Features} and pretrained on either the Indo-European or the Austronesian dataset, gives the best performance for the Mayan test set. The pretraining procedure is able to provide a good initialisation point to start training. Using this method, the \textit{CoAtt} model is thus able to beat the performance of best CNN model (\textit{CharCNN}) on the Mayan dataset. This also provides evidence to support our hypothesis that the \textit{CoAtt} was not able to learn on the Mayan dataset because of lack of enough data to train the network, but pre-training the model on other language families helped to show the true potential of the model on the dataset.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Cross Concept Evaluation}

We also conducted cross-concept evaluation experiments, where the training and testing datapoints were formed using exclusive sets of \textit{concepts} or \textit{meanings}. For this, we followed the same scheme as done by \cite{rama2016siamese}, wherein we took the first 70\% of the concepts as training concepts and the remaining concepts as testing concepts. The training and testing set size details formed using cross concept evaluation test can be found in Table~\ref{CC_res}. The results for the cross concept evaluation tests are listed in Table~\ref{CC_res}.

It is observed that the \textit{CoAtt} model is able to reach close to, but not improve on, the performance of the \textit{PhoneticCNN + Language Features} model for the Indo-European dataset. In fact, the \textit{CoAtt} model with pre-training and extra features reaches the performance of the \textit{CharCNN + Lang} model, but the \textit{PhoneticCNN + Lang} still leads by 3 points.

The cross-concept evaluation test can be thought of as a more rigorous test for cognate detection as the models have not seen any of the similar word structures during training. Words coming from different concepts would have different sequence structures altogether and for a model to predict cognate similarity in such a case would definitely have to exploit phoneme similarity information in the context of cognates.

\section{Analysis}

\subsection{Concept Wise Performance}

In this analysis of the models, we looked at the performance of various models over the individual concepts in the test set samples. It is observed that the performance of \textit{CoAtt} is more uniform throughout the concepts as compared to more varied distribution of the subsequence model. For concepts like WHAT, WHO, WHERE, HOW, THERE where the subsequence model performed poorly, the \textit{CoAtt} model is able to acheive high scores. The \textit{CoAtt} model performs poorly on a few selected concepts like AT, IF, IN, BECAUSE, GIVE. By looking at the samples, it is found that these concepts are heavily biased by negative samples and contain only a handful of positive cognate pair examples. In fact the subsequence model could not perform at all on these concepts as the highly biased data is coupled with almost no overlap of subsequences.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\textbf{Concept} & \textbf{CoAtt} & \textbf{Subseq} \\ \hline
WHAT             & \textit{0.91}  & \textit{0.04}   \\
WHO              & \textit{0.85}  & \textit{0.05}   \\
WHERE            & \textit{0.90}  & \textit{0.16}   \\
HOW              & \textit{0.90}  & \textit{0.17}   \\
THERE            & \textit{0.95}  & \textit{0.19}  \\
GIVE             & \textit{0.45}  & \textit{0.35}  \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{\textit{CoAtt} vs \textit{Subseq} model on various concepts (F-Score)}
\end{table}

\subsection{Transcription Tests}

As mentioned in an earlier section, the Indo-European dataset is available to us different transcriptions. The dataset is trascribed in ASJP like the other datasets and is also transcribed in IPA, which is a much finer representation as compared to ASJP. On comparing the models trained on these different transcriptions of the same data, it is found that the IPA model performs poorly on some concepts like GUTS, SWIM, WIPE, WHITE, SING where the ASJP model gives good results. On the other hand, the IPA model performs relatively better on concepts like FIRE, SLEEP, PULL, SAY and SMOOTH. By looking at specific examples, we find that for concepts like FIRE and PULL, the ASJP model gives many false positives which can be a fault due to the coarser representation of the ASJP character.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\textbf{Concept} & \textbf{IPA}  & \textbf{ASJP} \\ \hline
GUTS             & \textit{0.28} & \textit{0.58} \\
SWIM             & \textit{0.47} & 0.93          \\
WHITE            & \textit{0.54} & \textit{0.75} \\
WIPE             & \textit{0.55} & \textit{0.72} \\
SING             & \textit{0.56} & \textit{0.88} \\ \hline
FIRE             & \textit{0.62} & \textit{0.33} \\
SLEEP            & \textit{0.73} & 0.39          \\
PULL             & \textit{0.83} & \textit{0.50} \\
SMOOTH           & \textit{0.83} & \textit{0.50} \\
SAY              & \textit{0.90} & \textit{0.51}
\end{tabular}
\caption{\textit{CoAtt} model using IPA vs ASJP transcription on various concepts (F-Score)}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{swim}
  \caption{Sample test word pairs from the concept SWIM}
  \label{disssim}
\end{figure}

Figure 2 shows few test sample pairs from the concept SWIM. It is observed that for all of these samples, the IPA model falsely predicts negatives whereas the ASJP model is correctly able to predict them all as cognates. Here perhaps the very find representation in IPA throws the model's judgment off and its not able to pick up the correspondence correctly. It is also interesting to note that for all of these samples, adding the \textit{concept feature} of SWIM to the \textit{CoAtt + Concept Features} model makes it predict all of them as cognates. Thus, perhaps adding the concept features signals the model to relax the degree of overlapping of phonemes and become less strict in predicting cognates.

\subsection{Hindi-Marathi Domain Adaptation}

Finally we applied the \textit{CoAtt} model to the domain of Hindi-Marathi. The model was trained on the IELex dataset with IPA transcription with a character vocabulary of around 150 phonetic characters. The model was trained in a cross-language evaluation style. It should be noted that the IELex database contains instances from Marathi, but it does not directly contain instances from Hindi. However, it does contain words from Urdu and Bhojpuri (Bihari) which are also languages closely related to Hindi and share many words of the vocabulary with Hindi.

We used the TDIL sentence-aligned corpus. The corpus contains sentences from Hindi-Marathi that are POS tagged and transcribed in Devanagari. We specifically extracted word pairs from each sentence with the NOUN and VERB tags. Since the sentences are not word aligned, we extracted candidate word pairs for testing by choosing the first word with the same tag in either sentence as the candidate pair. The words were converted from Devanagari to IPA using a rule-based system and finally fed into the model. We extracted 16K pairs from Nouns and 9K pairs from Verbs.

On first observation it seems that the model is doing a fair job of aligning similar word pairs that are possibly cognates. We tested the performance of the model by randomly sampling 50 word pairs each from NOUNs and VERBs and manually annotating them. We found that our model gives an 80\% accuracy on Verbs and 74\% accuracy on Nouns. The model is able to find word pairs with a common stem without the need of lemmetization. In the case of verbs, it can be observed that the model is able to see through the inflections on the verbs to predict the pairs with similar stems as cognates.

\section{Conclusion}

The task of cognate discovery dwells into domain of finding rich hidden representation for words. It is found that simple surface similarity measures like common subsequence based features fail to capture the essence of phonological evolution and sound correspondences. Where there is large drift in the word structures and the characters of the words, these methods fail to capture any similarity between the words. Deep learning models like LSTMs are able to exploit such features to make better judgments on the prediction task. 

Cognate formation results from the evolution of sound changes in the words over time. From our experiments we have seen that there is a link in this evolution of sound class with the semantics of the words. Because words with different meanings are used in different frequencies, some appear to go through rapid adaptation and while others do not change by a lot. The models generally perform better on Nouns and Adjective words and they also have more number of cognate classes. In particular, words like \textit{`WHAT'}, \textit{`WHEN'}, \textit{`HOW'} show a lot of variation even within a cognate class, so much that some cognate word pairs do not share any subsequence. Introducing concept features to the models in the form of word embeddings is seen to help in improving the results. It is also found that joint training of the models with data from different language families is also useful.

By using deep learning models, the performance boosts are enough to test the model in an open domain. We applied our model to the Hindi-Marathi domain and found that the model is able to segregate the word pairs efficiently.
